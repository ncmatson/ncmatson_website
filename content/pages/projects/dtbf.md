Title: Distributed Beamforming with UAVs
[< back to Projects]({filename}../projects.md)

In this project, we wish to leverage the [heterogenous effect that the UAV body can have on wireless signal]({filename}../projects/a2a_3d.md) to our advantage to reduce the feedback overhead in a distributed beamforming scenario.  We have conducted some preliminary experiments that show that a receiver drone can impact the incoming phases of distributed transmit signals in such a way as to increase the received signal strength simply by rotating.
