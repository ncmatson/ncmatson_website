Title: Machine Learned Wireless Channel Codes

I'm currently investingating how to use machine learning, particularly to neural network autoencoders, to design capacity achieving codes for different types of wireless communication systems: multi-user channels, MIMO channels, wiretap channels.

Stay tuned...
