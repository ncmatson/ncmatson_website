Title: 3D Air-to-Air Channel Measurements

Our group at SMU has conducted several in-field measurement campaigns to study the effect of the drone body and 3D positioning on the Air-to-Air (A2A) Channel between multiple drones.
This work will inform updated models that will be usefull for intra-swarm communication.
