Title: 3D Air-to-Air Channel and Applications

Our group at SMU conducted several in-field measurement campaigns to study the effect of the drone body and 3D positioning on the Air-to-Air (A2A) Channel between multiple drones.  These measurements have been used to model potential applications of multi-UAV systems such as distributed beamforming.
