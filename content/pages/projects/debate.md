Title: Debate Piece
<!-- Date: 11/5/2021 -->

In Fall 2016 I took a class on Computer Music.  It was a mix of signal processing fundamentals from a musical perspective and practical instruction in producing digital music.  For my final project I composed/wrote/created an interactive [sonficiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonification) piece inspired by the 2016 presidential debates.  It was written using [PureData](https://puredata.info) which is a graphical programming language that allows you to create complex graphs that ultimately manipulate MIDI data.  I'm working on getting a recording/demo up to view, but you can check out the code on [github](https://github.com/ncmatson/debate-piece).
