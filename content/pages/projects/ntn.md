Title: Non-Terrestial Networks
[< back to Projects]({filename}../projects.md)
### Overview:
Low Earth Orbit satellite launches have proliferated in recent years.  Satellite communication networks offer the ability to provide true "anywhere" connectivity both for everyday use and emergency services.  My research in this area spans several topics including:

- Network orchestration: how does a network the scale of a mega-constellation cope with rapid, continuous infrastructure mobility? Especially in the strict context of 3GPP Non-Terretrial Networks.
- Emulation Platforms: Satellite networks and 3GPP Mobile Networks present challenging fields for researchers to conduct realistic, network-level experiments, even more so when we attempt to combine the two.  My work here is dedicated to building usable, realistic platforms that allow researchers to explore novel system-level designs.
- Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) for Space-Terrestrial Networks: Future mobile networks are expected to perform taks besides communication such as positioning and sensing (e.g. tracking moving objects).  This research focuses on exploring how we can leverage the LEO satellite networks as ubiquitous, mobile sensors to augment terrestrial network-based sensing.
