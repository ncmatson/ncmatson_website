Title: Radio Environment Mapping
[< back to Projects]({filename}../projects.md)
### Overview:
Radio environment maps (REMs) are a spatial reprentation of the wireless environment in a given area.  They can be critical for network planning, especially in dynamic, ad-hoc environments.  Typical ways of generating REMs like drive-testing are expensive and time consuming.  In this line of research we investiage how a mobile platform, such as a UAV, can be used to dynamically sample the wireless environment and fuse that information with additional sensors such as cameras using machine learning to build REMs quickly and accurately "on-the-fly."  

An example environment (left) with buildings of varying heights and the corresponding REM (right) is shown below.
