Title: About Me
save_as: index.html

I currnetly pursuing a PhD in [Electrical Engineering at Georgia Tech](http://ece.gatech.edu).  I'm a member of the [MÄ€RGA Lab](https://marga.ece.gatech.edu) under the dirction of [Prof. Karthikeyan Sundaresan](https://karthik.ece.gatech.edu).  

Perviously I completed my Master's Degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering at Southern Methodist University](https://www.smu.edu/Lyle/Academics/Departments/ECE).
My advisors were [Dinesh Rajan](https://s2.smu.edu/~rajand/) and [Joe Camp](https://s2.smu.edu/~camp/).  

My current research interests are in wireless systems, machine learning, and information theory.  I have undergraduate degrees from SMU in EE, Math, and Music.  I'm originally from Little Rock, Akansas.  Outside of research I enjoy watching and playing live music, watching and playing sports, and exploring the great outdoors.
