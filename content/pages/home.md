Title: About Me
save_as: index.html

I am a Master's student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Southern Methodist University](https://www.smu.edu/Lyle/Academics/Departments/ECE).
My advisors are [Dinesh Rajan](https://s2.smu.edu/~rajand/) and [Joe Camp](https://s2.smu.edu/~camp/).  My current research interests are in wireless systems, machine learning, and information theory.  I have undergraduate degrees from SMU in EE, Math, and Music.  I'm originally from Little Rock, Akansas.  Outside of research I enjoy watching and playing live music, watching and playing sports, and watching and playing outside.  I'm also a fan of parallelism.
